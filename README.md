# Simon-Says-Game

Simon Says is a classic memory-based game that challenges players to follow a sequence of commands in the correct order. It is simple, fun, and tests both concentration and memory retention.

üß† Game Concept:
The game presents a sequence of colored buttons lighting up.

The player must repeat the exact same sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.

With each round, the sequence becomes longer and more complex.

If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends.

üïπÔ∏è How It Works (Digital Version):
Start Game: Player clicks any keyboard button to start.

Simon‚Äôs Turn: A random sequence of button flashes (e.g., Red ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Green).

Player‚Äôs Turn: The player must replicate the exact sequence by clicking the same buttons in the same order.

Next Level: If correct, the game adds one more color to the sequence and repeats.

Game Over: If the player clicks the wrong color, the game stops and shows the final score or level reached.

üé® Common Elements:
4 Colored buttons (usually: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)

Sound effects matching each color
